# Blackjack-Game
Blackjack is a popular card game that involves comparing cards between a player and a dealer. To create a digital version of the game, HTML and CSS were used for the layout and design of the game interface, while JavaScript was used to implement the game logic, such as  dealing cards, and keeping score. JavaScript also allowed for interactivity between the player and the game, such as the ability to hit or stand and make decisions based on the cards dealt. Overall, JavaScript played a crucial role in bringing the game to life and creating an engaging user experience.
